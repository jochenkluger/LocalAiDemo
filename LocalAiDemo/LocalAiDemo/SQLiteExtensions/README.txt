SQLite Vector Search Extensions (VSS) go in this directory.

The following files need to be added:
- vss0.dll (for Windows)
- libvss0.so (for Android/Linux)
- libvss0.dylib (for iOS/macOS)

You can obtain these files from the SQLite-vec extension project or build them from source - https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vec/releases/tag/v0.1.6
